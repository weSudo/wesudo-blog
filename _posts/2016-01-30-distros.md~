###Some notable Linux Distros 


##* [Arch linux](https://aur.archlinux.org/) 

This linux distro is aimed at experienced users. When you install arch; you install it from scratch. This means you have to install the Desktop environment, the package manager etc from scratch. Its quite time consuming and has a steep learning curve but in the end you end up learning a lot about the workings of linux behind the scenes and you have a distro that is custom built for you. That measn every arch installation is different from the other. Installing Arch can be difficult and you need to be well versed with the technicalities of the field. A complete beginer is not recommended. However If you want you can try it.

For more details check out the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch_Linux) page on Arch.

* [Debian](www.debian.org)

When talking about linux distros the first thing that comes to mind is Debian. This project was started by Ian Murdoch in 1993. The name Debian is a combination of his name and his then girlfriend's name Debra Lynn. 

Today Debian has the largest collection of packages(softwares or applications in laymans terms) around 43000(as reported by its [website](www.debian.org)). [Distrowatch](www.distrowatch.com) reports that debian has about 160 active derivatives. 

Many popular operating systems like Ubuntu etc etc are derived from Debian. Debian is one of the most important mother distros. 

Debian is also targetted towards the experieced folk with special interest towrds server applications especially since Debian is very stable (someone reported 1+ year run time withone a single reboot!)

Debian is not entirely made up of free repos(repositories or places where they store their softwares). It cantains a combination of both free and  paid repos. 

For more information check out the [Wikpedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian) link.

* [Elementary OS](https://elementary.io)

Elementary OS is a Linux distro based on Ubuntu. This OS uses the Pantheon DE(Desktop Environment) and is built specifically to introduce the Pantheon DE. 

Unlike other distros the main focus of this distro is the User Experience so the GUI is beautiful, looks fresh(unlike KDE or GNOME) and is really really awesome. All Mac OS fans(GUI only) are encouraged to try this one out. This is a powerful distro and is good looking too.

However there is always a catch. Elementary has no definite release cycle. The team follows a "release when ready" principle which ,means that you are not likely to get freequent updates. The team is comparatively small and new compared to other BIG distros but this just the starting of a promising new distro. BTW when you do get the updates for Elementary expect a rock solid update(an update that doesn't break anything) as they are released after thorough testing.

For more information check out the [Wikipeida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_OS) link.

* [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/)

Feodra is for the early adopters in the Linux world. This is a free open-source distro that is funded by Red Hat. It contains only free repos. Fedora leads in the security region with SELinux(Security Enhanced Linux) support. Unlike Debian it follows a strict release timeline. Fedora is also not aimed at newbies, it's for experienced linux users who want to be on the bleeding edge of technological revolution. This means that if you use Fedora you will get the *brand new* in the tech world. Sometimes this means that update may not be fully stable; But for the early adopters this is a good thing as they get to find holes within the code and play the detective on teh scene. ;-)

Fedora got some endorsement when Linus Torvalds said that he uses Fedora. YaY!!

For more information check out the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fedora_(operating_system)) link.

* [Gentoo Linux](https://www.gentoo.org/)

Gentoo Linux is *the* distro if you want to learn actual Linux. This distro is aimed at very very advanced users*and/or enthusiasts) and sysadmins. Gentoo generally runs on Servers and other multi user environments. Its not recommended for desktop useage.

The interesting thing about Gentoo is that there is no installer for Gentoo. You yourself are the installer i.e. you need to compile the source specifically for your own system. What this means for the user is that you get the ideal and the best possible system for your computer since the OS is compiled *on* your hardware *for* your hardware. So the software is married to the hardware. 

Installing Gentoo can be a great learning experience for users. For more information check out the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentoo_Linux) link.
 
* [RHEL](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux)

RHEL stands for Red Hat Enterprise Linux. This is a paid distro(you don't pay for Linux, but you pay for the service Red Hat offers) and once again it is aimed at Enterprise level organisations(think Air Traffic Controllers and satellite stations and Stock Exchanges etc). This mainly runs on servers as it is very very stable. The stabality is due to its 6-month release cycle which means that the distro is heavily tested before the next release. Also you get excellent paid support from Red Hat.

Debian is also aimed at servers but it comes second to RedHat cause its support is little slow. However Debian wins in all the other aspects. The dependency resolver (apt-get) is way better than the one used in RHEL and Debian community believes that software is a continuous evolutioin so they release new updates almost daily. 

For more information check out the [Wikpedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux link. 

* [Steam OS](http://store.steampowered.com/steamos/)

SteamOS is for the gaming afficionados. It is released by Vlave corporatiion for their Steam Machine. Steam Machines that run SteamOS and are mainly used for gaming. They come with out-of-the box support for Graphics cards and other gaming hardware. It is based on Debian too. 

Check out the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SteamOS) link. 

* [T.A.I.L.S](https://tails.boum.org/)

Tails is an acronym of The Amnesic Incognito Live System. This for the security and/or annonimity fanatics amongst you people.

The advantages of tails is that you *cannot* install it on a computer. You can only use tails in live mode. In this mode you can use all the packaged software and it wont leave *any* footprint on the actual OS of the system. All internet traffic is routed via The Onion Router(tor) so you get complete annonimity.

Tails is based on debian and is a free software.

Tails is endorsed by Edward Snowden for obvious reasons. ;-)

* [Trisquel](https://trisquel.info/)

Trisquel is a Ubuntu based distro that is endorsed by the GNU and the FSF for being completely free. In other words if you are a FSF fanatic this is the distro for you.

* [Ubuntu](www.ubuntu.com)

This is a Linux distro that is aimed at noobs, with its flashy gui and user friendsly ui and it's main purpose is to make Linux as a desktop Os popular. The company that supports Ubuntu is Cannonical. Ubuntu is also based in Debian. 
 
This distro is for personal computers and not aimed at power users. However since its based on Debian it can used as such with little tweaking.

If you are new to Linux then Ubuntu should be your first OS. Period. Ubuntu supports both free and non-free softwares as well as proprietory software.
Wkipedia link [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu)

* [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org)

Despite what the name suggests this is *not* named after the Hindu goddess Kali. This is distro that is specifically built for Digital Forensics and Penetration Testing (hackers in easy terms). When they say built for hackers they mean it. This distro is comes preinstalled with *lots*(read over-600) Penetration Testing tools.	 

This is also based on Debian and most Kali tools are also available on Debian as well.

##Conclusion
So let me wrap up shop with a sweet analogy.

With so many distros to choose from actually choosing a Linux distro is like walking into Baskin-Robbins and choosing the perfect flavour of ice cream. The point is there *isn't* any perfect flavour for everyone. This is the reason so many distros developed in the first  place. 

Important thing is to forget about that *perfect distro* as the concept of a perfect distro would be possible only if we lived in a perfect world but since we dont we can forget about it. So choose a distro and keep moving from there. You just *can't* go wrong with Linux. 


P.S. Our list is not arranged in the order of our preference.
P.P.s. We used the Baskin-Robbins analogy cause we couldn't fathom anyone not liking ice cream. If you are offendedplease accept our sincerest apology.
